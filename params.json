{"name":"Aerospace-modeling-simulation","tagline":"Developing codes & learning scientific computing to solve common problems in Aerospace Engineering using Python, a very good free alternative. An online community where we can collaborate and create python codes specific to different areas of aerospace engineering like Control and Guidance laws, CFD, FEM etc. using libraries like numpy, scipy and matplotlib. The intention is NOT to create a standalone package or to commercialize it, we could deal with specific problems and submit our little codes for comparing it with each other. This can help us learn more about mathematical modeling and application of therotical concepts. Please feel free to contribute, participate, learn and grow! ","body":"> Terminal Velocity (Basic level) - Submit your Python code!  \r\nA very simple problem to program, write a code for calculating terminal velocity and time to impact.\r\nUsers can optionally consider the International Standard Atmosphere to account for change in density at \r\nregular intervals of altitude. There is also a scope for including change in the drag coefficient due \r\nto compressibility effects if you have additional knowledge on the subject. \r\n[Click here for theory reference](http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/termv.html)\r\n\r\nPlease go to \"Branches\" and select an approprite topic to view and contribute code.\r\nContributors can also submit their code from a different topic and an appropriate\r\nbranch will be created for the same.\r\n\r\nYou may require Python 3, NumPy, Matplotlib to run codes. No code uses SciPy as of \r\nnow but it might be required later.\r\n\r\nContributors are free to use any additional module as long as it is freely available\r\nand compatible with Python 3.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
