An online community where we can collaborate and create python codes specific to different areas of aerospace engineering like Control and Guidance laws, CFD, FEM etc. using libraries like numpy, scipy and matplotlib. The intention is NOT to create a standalone package or to commercialize it, we could deal with specific problems and submit our little codes for comparing it with each other. This can help us learn more about mathematical modeling and application of therotical concepts. Please feel free to contribute, participate, learn and grow! " />

<p>Terminal Velocity (Basic level) - Submit your Python code!<br>
A very simple problem to program, write a code to for calculating terminal velocity and time to impact.
Users can optionally consider the International Standard Atmosphere to account for change in density at 
regular intervals of altitude. There is also a scope for including change in the drag coefficient due 
to compressibility effects if you have additional knowledge on the subject.

<p>Please go to "Branches" and select an approprite topic to view and contribute code.
Contributors can also submit their code from a different topic and an appropriate
branch will be created for the same.</p>

<p>You may require Python 3, NumPy, Matplotlib to run codes. No code uses SciPy as of 
now but it might be required later.</p>

<p>Contributors are free to use any additional module as long as it is freely available
and compatible with Python 3.</p>
